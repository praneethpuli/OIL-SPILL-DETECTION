Oil Spill Detection using AIS and Satellite Data

📌Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting oil spills using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data
and satellite imagery. The aim is to integrate real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing
to enable early detection of oil spills at sea. This helps in environmental protection, economic stability, 
and operational efficiency.

📊 Dataset
The project utilizes:
AIS (Automatic Identification System) data: Real-time vessel tracking data, including vessel speed, 
location, heading, and cargo details.
Satellite Images: Spaceborne satellite datasets used to detect oil leaks and confirm anomalies 
detected by AIS data.

🔍 Working Process
Data Collection:
AIS data provides vessel tracking details (speed, position, type, etc.).
Satellite images detect oil spills visually.
Preprocessing:
Data cleaning, feature extraction, and noise reduction.
Alignment of AIS and satellite data for better analysis.
Oil Spill Detection:
Machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) classify the presence of oil spills.
Anomalies in AIS data (sudden speed change, erratic movement) trigger further investigation.
Visualization:
Web interface displays results using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🌊 Outcomes
Early detection of oil spills using real-time AIS and satellite data.
Timely response to marine pollution incidents.
Better monitoring of maritime activities to prevent environmental hazards.
